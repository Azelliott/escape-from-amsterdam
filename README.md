## Escape from Amsterdam

Escape from Amsterdam is a small retro text based advanture game that draws 
inspiration from games like Zork and Slouching Towards Bedlam.

Because best 3D engine is your own imagination :)

The story follows main protagonist who wakes up in what looks like a hotel room in Amsterdam. His memory is hazy, but the rules are clear.

Find the snippets of code hidden around the room to get out of the room until door is locked...Forever.
